# The name of the database. This is usually not of any importance
[ ParMooN database for TNSE2D ]

## This is the file where all output of ParMooN is (usually) written 
## to. In general ParMooN produces text output on the console as well 
## as in this file. For this to properly work, you should call 
## `Output::set_outfile(db["outfile"]);` in your main program. 
outfile: default_parmoon_outfile.out

## This is a file describing the boundary of the computational 
## domain. You probably want to adjust this to be the path to some file 
## which typically has the extension 'PRM'. See the documentation 
## for GEO and PRM files. 
boundary_file: Default_UnitSquare

## This files describes the computational mesh. You probably want to 
## adjust this to be the path to some file which typically has the 
## extension 'GEO' or 'xGEO'. See the documentation for GEO and PRM 
## files.

## Do or do not compute errors after computing a solution. This makes

## often simply set to zero and computing errors then means computing 
## norms, e.g. the L^2-norm of the solution. 
output_compute_errors: true   { true, false }

## This parameter, when true, allows the output numbering 
## to continue after a simulation restart, which is often a

## stopping criterion. Whenever the residual is smaller than the

## is terminated. A value of 0.0 therefore effectively disables this 
## stopping criterion. 
residual_reduction: 0   [ 0, 1 ]

## The number of gmres iterations until a restart is done. Larger 
## numbers lead to more memory consumption, smaller numbers 
## typically mean more iterations.

## The damping in an iteration. A value of 1.0 means no damping while

## damping), a value of 0.8 is often a good start.
