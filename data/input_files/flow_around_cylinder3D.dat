[ ParMooN database for NSE3D ]

## This is the file where all output of ParMooN is (usually) written 
## to. In general ParMooN produces text output on the console as well 
## as in this file. For this to properly work, you should call 
## `Output::set_outfile(db["outfile"]);` in your main program. 
outfile: flow_around_cylinder.out

## This is a file describing the boundary of the computational 
## domain. You probably want to adjust this to be the path to some file 
## which typically has the extension 'PRM'. See the documentation 
## for GEO and PRM files.

## The damping in an iteration. A value of 1.0 means no damping while
